# Computational-Methods-in-Stochastics

This repository includes assignments of the course "Computational-Methods-in-Stochastics".
Each assignment will tackle a different problem and a new concept.

In order, the assignments will be about :

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Simulating standard probability distributions.
 \item Methods of simulating 'non-standard' distributions. Logarithmic binning.
 \item Monte Carlo (MC) method and Metropolis sampling.
 \item Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method; Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
 \item Hamiltonian/Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method.
\end{enumerate}

In each folder, there will two files. A pdf copy of the assignment, and
a notebook (.ipynb) of my personal take on the assignment.
